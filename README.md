# Frontend coding challenge

### Install Dependencies
> npm i

### Run Dev Server
> npm start

#
For this assignment I tried to follow the live product's style however some descrepencies are still there, mostly to keep the development time under wrap. The application is setup inline with the scope. That's why I have not used **Redux** or any state management libraries and instead used native react solutions (Context API). This helped to keep the stack lean and avoid boilerplate hell.

#
## Some of the things I worked on
*  Autocomplete UI element with keyboard controls
*  Logo Animation - A little motion is always a crowd pleaser
*  SPA with client side routing
*  Minimal Dependencies - Only React, React-Router and MaterialUI were used

#
A live version is deployed [here](https://eerlijkewoz.vercel.app/) but because of CORS policy on the address resolution api it won't work. Perhaps I could delegate the data fetching onto cloud functions to get around that.
